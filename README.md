# Marketplace

This repository consists of a NFT marketplace project in which users can create single NFTs(ERC721) or multiple NFTs(ERC1155) and list them on the marketplace. Users can also earn royalties if they create and list their NFTs on this platform.

That's not it !!

There's one ERC20 token which you can use for making offers on different NFTs (only ERC721s) that are not even listed on the platform and this token is also used for bidding on different NFT auctions (only ERC721s) created on this platform.
[This dependency on a single ERC20 token gives some use case or utility to this basic ERC20 token, which can add value to it ;-) ]

Multiple NFTs (ERC1155s) have a simple listing and buying function but at the time of listing the owner can convert that listing to a private one i.e. Only the wallet addresses specified by the listing owner are elligible for buying the NFTs.
 
At last, the platform owner can also set a small fees on all the trades.
